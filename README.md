## Introduction
Anoodfi is a crypto-synthetic trading protocol that uses a price feed and a liquidity pool to make markets. An automated market maker modeled by Gaussian functions quotes prices to traders. Users can trade with leverage using a fair system that shares margin across positions to minimize liquidation risk. Anyone can participate in the liquidity pool by buying AND tokens, which track each userâ€™s share in the pool. Some components of the protocol that rely on speed and low cost are managed off-chain.
